  MyAgents Hardened Runtime Entitlements
  
  NOTE: The allow-jit, allow-unsigned-executable-memory, and disable-library-validation
  entitlements are REQUIRED for Bun JavaScript runtime to function.
  Removing these will cause the sidecar process to crash on launch.
  
  These are documented requirements for most JavaScript runtimes on macOS.
  The app is still notarized by Apple which provides Gatekeeper protection.
